# Ecompatible (For Server Owners)

## Ecompatible Shovel Config

You can configure this mod to act the same as the "Big Shovel" mod by changing the values in the server config "EcompatibleShovel.eco".

## Ecompatible Axe Config

You can configure this mod to act similar to the "Easy Logging" and other logging mods. The config file is "EcompatibleAxe.eco".

## How to set them

If you are running your server on Windows then you can access these configuration files through the server GUI window that appears when you launch the server, otherwise copy the contents of "Configs/EcompatibleShovel.eco.template" to a new file "Configs/EcompatibleShovel.eco" and change the values in there. Same goes for the axe config.
