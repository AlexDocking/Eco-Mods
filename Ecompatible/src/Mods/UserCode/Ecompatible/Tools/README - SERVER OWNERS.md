# Ecompatible (For Server Owners)

## Ecompatible (Big) Shovel Config

You can configure this mod to act the same as the "Big Shovel" mod. The default values for how much each shovel type can pick up, as well as whether they should be affected by the server's stack size multiplier, can be set in the server config "EcompatibleShovel". Other mods can then make their changes based on those values.

If you are running your server on Windows then you can access this configuration file through the server GUI window that appears when you launch the server, otherwise copy the contents of "Configs/EcompatibleShovel.eco.template" to a new file "Configs/EcompatibleShovel.eco" and change the values in there.
