# My Eco Mods

This repository houses several of my public mods for Eco, and because of the dependencies between them they share a single repo for ease of updating them.

You can find out more in their individual project folders.

### Ecompatible

This is a library for help other mods be compatible with each other.

### XP Benefits

This is a mod that gives various quality-of-life improvements to players if they invest in high tier food and housing.

### Replacement Interactions

This is a library to help mods replace interaction parameters or replace the implementation of interactions without overriding the file.

### Eco Test Tools

This is a library my other mods use to help run automated tests.

## Licensing Explanation

"Replacement Interactions" and "Eco Test Tools" are licensed under Apache 2.0 because they are simply too small in scope and usage to bother with anything more substantial.

### Ecompatible

Ecompatible is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). I've chosen this license because the project is intended to be a shared resource for multiple mods from independent authors. LGPL ensures that:
1. Improvements to the library by others are shared and able to be used by all other modders.
2. If at any point I no longer keep the project up to date then others will be able to take it on to provide continued support to mods that depend on it.
3. Using the library does not limit which licenses a modder can publish their mod under, unlike GPL.

### XP Benefits

The latest version of XP Benefits is distributed without a license, whereas versions v1.x.x have used GPL. Until SLG gives more details about how they will determine which mods can and can't profit from their marketplace sales, I don't want to license it with terms I might later be unhappy with. Open Source permits commercial use without restriction, and if SLG don't exercise sufficient control over their platform then nothing would prevent others from uploading exact copies of the mod for profit. Undermining the modder's hard work this way provides no value to either the community or the mod developer. Since there are no ready made anti-free-riding equivalent licenses then the 'no license' is what I have chosen. That doesn't mean I have an issue with you making and sharing changes to the code, but that is too vague to put in a license.

Thank you for reading.
