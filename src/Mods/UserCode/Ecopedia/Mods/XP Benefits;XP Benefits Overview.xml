		This server uses a mod called XP Benefits. Various quality-of-life perks are able to be earnt, which act in addition to those given by [SelfImprovementSkill]. Unlike [SelfImprovementSkill] these benefits do not give permanent buffs. Instead, they are tied directly to your food and housing XP multipliers, so require continual upkeep to maintain.
